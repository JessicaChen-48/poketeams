## Welcome to Pokemon Teams!

Pokemon Teams is a small web app where users can select a Pokemon type and a randomized team of 6 Pokemon of that type is created for that user. 

Pokemon Teams is a **front-end** personal project built using **React** and vanilla **CSS3**. This app uses the PokeApi to get all of the information about the Pokemon - including the enumerated Pokemon types, sprite images, names, and flavor text!

All of the results are randomly chosen from the available Pokemon of that type - no two teams are ever the same! Additionally, the flavor text presented in English is also randomized, so even if you do happen to see the same Pokemon twice, you might learn a new fact with new flavor text!

I hope you enjoy playing with my project as much as I enjoyed building it!
